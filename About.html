            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the Danquah Family!
              We are a loving Christian family from Ghana, united by faith, love, and shared values. Our family began in 1998 when our wonderful parents, Ernest Danquah and Dorcas Danquah, tied the knot, laying the foundation for a home filled with love and joy. We are blessed with four amazing children: Keziah, Jemimah, Caleb and Michelle.
